Corona Prediction
Project Overview
This repository is dedicated to predicting the likelihood of Corona presence based on a set of diverse features. The dataset undergoes meticulous loading and preprocessing to handle missing values and categorical variables effectively.

Data Visualization
A comprehensive heatmap is generated to visualize the correlation between independent variables and the target variable (Corona), providing valuable insights into the dataset's underlying patterns.

Model Application and Evaluation
The repository employs two robust classification models, namely K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree. Each model is meticulously evaluated for accuracy, ensuring a thorough assessment of their predictive capabilities.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Algorithm: KNeighborsClassifier
Number of Neighbors: 5
Accuracy: {knn_accuracy}
Decision Tree
Algorithm: DecisionTreeClassifier
Accuracy: {dt_accuracy}
This project invites contributions and collaboration to further enhance the predictive accuracy and robustness of the implemented models. Your engagement is highly valued in advancing the field of predictive analytics.
